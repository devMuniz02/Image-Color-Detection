# Image-Color-Detection

Code to detect RGB colors in images.

---

## Project Overview
This project provides a tool to identify and analyze RGB color values from images. It can be used in various applications, such as image processing, design, and computer vision tasks.

---

## Features
- **Color Detection**: Extracts RGB values from images with precision.
- **Visualization**: Highlights detected colors in the input image for better understanding.
- **Custom Image Support**: Works with a variety of image formats and resolutions.

## Example
Below is an example of the color detection system:

### Input Image
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/sample_image.jpg" alt="Input Image" width="300">

### Detected Colors
```
Color 1: RGB(255, 0, 0) - Red
Color 2: RGB(0, 255, 0) - Green
Color 3: RGB(0, 0, 255) - Blue
```
